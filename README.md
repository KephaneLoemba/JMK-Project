## Project details
Our idea with this project is to create a personal assistant application that helps with one's daily life.

The application does this by displaying the local weather to the most recent hour. In addition this application also includes a section for your everyday calender. With this you may create or delete events at specific times on whichever days you prefer. Lastly, this application also includes a news section that will display the top 5 article titles with their respective links from the New York Times website. This also includes a feature that allows you to favorite articles you enjoy.

This application is designed to help people organize and plan their day conveniently.
